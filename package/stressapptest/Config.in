	  Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) is a memory interface test.
	 	It tries to maximize randomized traffic to memory from processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic high load situation in order to test the existing hardware devices in a computer. It has been used at Google for some time and now it is available under the apache 2.0 license.
